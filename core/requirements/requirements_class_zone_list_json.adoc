[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/zone-json/content
part:: Every 200 response of the server for zone query with the media type `application/json` SHALL be a JSON document listing the textual identifiers for all zones matching the query.
part:: The schema for the JSON document SHALL follow the JSON Schema for DGGS Zone Query described below, where the zone identifiers are strings within a `zones` array property.
part:: The `links` property SHALL include an `[ogc-rel:dggrs]` link to the Discrete Global Grid Reference System description resource.
part:: The `links` property SHALL include an `[ogc-rel:dggrs-definition]` link to the DGGRS definition, using the schema defined in <<annex-dggrs-def, Annex B - DGGRS Definitions>> or a later version.

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-json/additional-links
part:: If _DGGS Zone Data Retrieval_ is supported, the `linkTemplates` property SHOULD include an `[ogc-rel:dggrs-zone-data]` link with a `{zoneId}` variable to retrieve data from each of these DGGRS zones.
part:: The `links` property SHOULD include an `[ogc-rel:geodata]` link for zone listing pertaining to a particular collection (for <<rc_collection-dggs,Collection DGGS requirement class>>).
====

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-json/zone-order
part:: For responses where zones of multiple hierarchy levels are returned when `compact-zones` is true, the zones SHOULD be listed with the coarser resolution level first (larger zones).
====

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/zone-json/zone-total-area
description:: For returning the total area (or volumes) occupied by zones returned by the query
part:: For a 2D DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedAreaMetersSquare` property indicating the total surface area occupied by the zones being returned,
adding the overlaps which may occur for compact zone responses where zones are non-congruent only once.
part:: For a 3D DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedVolumeMetersCube` property indicating the total volume occupied by the zones being returned, still counting overlapping regions only once.
part:: For a 2D + Time DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedVolumeMetersSquareSeconds` property indicating the total volume occupied by the zones being returned, still counting overlapping regions only once.
part:: For a 3D + Time DGGS, the Implementation SHOULD include in the response a `returnedHyperVolumeMetersCubeSeconds` property indicating the total hypervolume occupied by the zones being returned, still counting overlapping regions only once.
