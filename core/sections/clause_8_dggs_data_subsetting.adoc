== Requirement Class "Data Subsetting"

=== Overview

The Data Subsetting requirements class extends the zone data retrieval requirements with the ability
to subset data on additional dimensions beyond those defined by the discrete global grid reference systems (DGGRS),
for example along time or vertical dimension if those axes are not part the DGGRS definition, or along additional dimensions
such as atmospheric pressure levels. Two parameters are defined for this purpose: `datetime` (specifically for time) and
`subset` (for any dimension, including time). Additionally, this requirement class defines the `properties` parameter
to select specific fields to include in the response instead of all fields which are included by defaults.
