== Requirements Class "Core"

=== Overview

An implementation of the DGGS API "Core" Requirements Class enables a client to list available DGGRSs for a given resource,
retrieve additional information about a particular DGGRS, and retrieve information about a particular DGGRS zone.

The "Core" Requirements Class is the only mandatory Requirements Class. However, an implementation with practical use
is expected to additionally implement either the <<rc_data-retrieval,"Zone Data Retrieval">> Requirements Class, so that a client can ask a question of the type _**"What is here?"**_
and/or the <<rc_zone-query,"Zone Query">> Requirements Class, so that a client can ask a question of the type _**"Where is it?"_**.
To conform to this standard, either or both of these additional requirements classes also needs to be implemented.
