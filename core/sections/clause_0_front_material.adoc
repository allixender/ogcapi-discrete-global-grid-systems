OGC API Standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. OGC API Standards use the OpenAPI specification for describing the API building blocks.

_OGC API - Discrete Global Grid Systems_ provides API building blocks to retrieve data and query zones based on Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) concepts defined in
https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-040r3/20-040r3.html[OGC Abstract Topic 21].
Additional parts for _OGC API - Discrete Global Grid Systems_ may be defined in the future to provide additional capabilities.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Abstract

This specification defines building blocks which can be used as part of a Web API to retrieve geospatial data for a specific
area, time and resolution of interest, based on a specific Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) and indexing scheme,
as defined in https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-040r3/20-040r3.html[OGC Abstract Topic 21], as well to query the list of DGGS zones from which data is available and/or
matching a specified query, in combination with other building blocks defining queries, such as a filter defined using
the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065.html[OGC Common Query Language (CQL2)].
