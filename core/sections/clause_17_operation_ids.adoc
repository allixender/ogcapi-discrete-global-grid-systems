== Requirements Class "API definition Operation IDs"

The OGC API - DGGS Standard does not mandate any particular API definition language. However, if the API is described using a definition language supporting
operation identifiers, such as OpenAPI 3.0, being able to associate the functionality described in these requirements with an operation defined in the language is useful.
This requirements class defines how this is achieved.
