== Discrete Global Grid Reference System Definitions

The following informative schema describes the expected response of the resource linked to by using the `[ogc-rel:dggrs-definition]` link relation
from the DGGRS description, as specified by the <<rc_core,Core requirement class>>.
An important objective for this schema is to support establishing authoritative registries of DGGRSs providing a URI for a DGGRS corresponding to a specific definition.

Note that this schema is preliminary, and a normative version may be defined by a later version of this standard
or by a future part of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 21.
The schema may change to allow for better description of existing and new classes of DGGS.

The DGGRS definition consists of three main components:

* the definition of the hierarchy of discrete global grids (`dggs`), including any parameterization such as the spheroid or orientation, establishing both the topology as well as the geometry of every zone,
* the Zonal Identifier Reference System (`zirs`), with textual identifiers being mandatory while 64-bit integer identifiers (which support the <<rc_zone-binary64bit,64-bit integer zone list encoding requirement class>>) are optional,
* the sub-zone ordering (`subZoneOrder`), which allows for <<rc_data-retrieval,retrieving zone data>> using e.g., <<rc_data-json,DGGS-JSON>> at a <<rc_data-custom-depths,`zone-depth`>> other than 0 (the values of sub-zones can be provided as a 1D array of values with a pre-established association to sub-zones).

=== ISEA9R DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an axis-aligned and equal-area DGGS based on the https://doi.org/10.3138/27H7-8K88-4882-1752[Icosahedral Snyder Equal-Area (ISEA)] planar projection (see https://proj.org/en/9.4/operations/projections/isea.html[PROJ] and https://github.com/mocnik-science/geogrid/blob/master/src/main/java/org/giscience/utils/geogrid/projections/ISEAProjection.java[geogrid] for open-source implementations) using rhombuses with a refinement ratio of 9.
When the ISEA projection is rotated 60 degrees, sheared horizontally by 30 degrees and units are mapped to a 5x6 space, the zones become square and their edges are aligned with the CRS axes, while remaining equal-area.
A https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[2D Tile Matrix Set] can also be defined in this transformed CRS, allowing for compatibility with https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[OGC API - Tiles], https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=35326[WMTS] and traditional client and visualization software with no built-in DGGS functionality.
This transformed CRS no longer preserves angles and distances, although the topology, indexing and surface geometry on the Earth model remains the same as in the original ISEA CRS where angles and distances are preserved.

=== ISEA3H DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an ISEA3H DGGS, also based on the ISEA planar projection, with hexagonal and pentagonal zones, and a refinement ratio of 3, using a zone reference system based in part on its dual relationship with the ISEA9R DGGS.
The DGGS is considered equal-area, although the 12 pentagonal zones at any level occupy 5/6th of the area of hexagonal zones.

The sub-zone ordering for this DGGRS is based on scanlines of tightly packed hexagons, sharing whole edges
with the previous and next zone within a scanline, while each zone shares two edges with the
scanline above, and another two edges with the scanline below. The scanlines start on a vertex of the parent zone
for an even relative depth, while they start on an edge for an odd relative depth.

=== GNOSIS Global Grid DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is based on the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#toc58[variable width 2D Tile Matrix Set of the same name].
The GNOSIS Global Grid is also axis-aligned, with the axes being the geographic latitude and longitude, and already corresponds to a registered 2DTMS.
Through the variable width capability of the tile matrices, this DGGS approximates equal area.
For example, at any refinement level, only 4 zones touch each pole.
Since the error budget still exceeds the 1%, it cannot be considered equal area.
However, the error is the same along a particular row of zones following latitude lines, and can easily be calculated.
Since its native axes are latitude and longitude, no additional reprojection is required to import data to or export data from this DGGS.
