== Scope

This OGC Standard specifies a Web API that enables the direct retrieval of geospatial data for a specified area, time and resolution of interest, based on a specific DGGS and indexing scheme and/or the query of DGGS resources to return a list of DGGS Zones from which data is available. Queries can be specified in combination with other building blocks defining queries, such as a filter defined using
the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065.html[OGC Common Query Language (CQL2)].
