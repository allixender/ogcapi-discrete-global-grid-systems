== Requirement Class "Core"

=== Overview

The "Core" Requirement Class allows a client to list available DGGRSs for a given resource,
retrieve additional information about a particular DGGRS, and retrieve information about a particular DGGRS zone.

The "Core" Requirement Class is the only mandatory Requirements Class, but an implementation with practical use
is expected to additionally implement either the <<rc_data-retrieval,"Zone Data Retrieval">> Requirement Class, so that a client can ask a question of the type _**"What is here?"**_
and/or the <<rc_zone-query,"Zone Query">> Requirement Class, so that a client can ask a question of the type _**"Where is it?"_**.
