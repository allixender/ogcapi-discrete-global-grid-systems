== Requirement Class "Core"

=== Overview

The "Core" Requirement Class allows a client to list available DGGRSs for a given resource,
retrieve additional information about a particular DGGRS, and retrieve information about a particular DGGRS zone.

The "Core" Requirement Class is the only mandatory Requirements Class, but an implementation with practical use
is expected to additionally implement either the "Zone Data Retrieval" Requirement Class, the "Zone Query" Requirement Class, or both.
