== Requirements Class for API definition operation IDs

This standard does not mandate any particular API definition language, but if the API is described using a definition language supporting
operation identifiers, such as OpenAPI 3.0, allowing to associate the functionality described in these requirements with an operation defined in the language,
this requirement class defines how this is achieved.
