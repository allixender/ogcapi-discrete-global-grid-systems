== Requirement Class "Data Custom Depths"

=== Overview

The Data Custom Depths requirements class extends the zone data retrieval requirements class allowing a client
to customize which depths to include as part of a zone data response relative to the requested hierarchy level for which data is being requested.
This can be either a single depth, a range of depths, or a list of depths.
The depths to include in the response are specified using the `zone-depth` query parameter.
This depth customization ability can be restricted by the capability of the particular zone data response encoding negotiated.
