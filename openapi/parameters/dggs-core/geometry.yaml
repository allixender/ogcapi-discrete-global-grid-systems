description: |-
   For vector output formats, specify how to return the geometry and/or what the features of the response should represent.
   `vectorized`: return features with regular non-rasterized, non-quantized geometry
   `zone-centroid`: rasterize to zone features and use a Point geometry representing that zone centroid
   `zone-region`: rasterize to zone features and use a (Multi)Polygon/Polyhedron geometry representing that zone's region
   `quantized`: (DGGS-FG-JSON) return vector geometry with coordinates quantized to sub-zones, represented as local indices from 1 to the number of sub-zones corresponding to the DGGRS deterministic sub-zone order, with a special value of 0 representing an artificial node
   `quantized-zoneids`: (DGGS-FG-JSON) return vector geometry with coordinates quantized to sub-zones, represented as global textual zone identifiers, with a special value of _null_ representing an artificial node
   `none`: (for zone listing) omit zone geometry
